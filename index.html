<h2>Project 1) Building an Electric Bass</h2>
<p1>
	After being a guitarist for 3 years, I'd decided that I wanted to try my hands at building a guitar.
 I also wanted to pick up bass as my second instrument, so I figured that it would be a great idea to combine those two ideas together and build my own bass!
 I bought a bass kit on amazon which included the body, neck, and all neccesary hardware for me to make a bass.

<h2>Project 2) Analog Modular synth</h2>
<p1> 
	I wanted a modular synth, and I wanted an electronics project to keep my skills sharp.
 So I started looking into different schematics to build and found this wonderful youtube series by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MoritzKlein0?app=desktop">Moritz Klein</a>.
 I've taken his schematics and lightly adjusted them to add some extra goodies.
