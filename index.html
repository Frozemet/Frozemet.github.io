<h2>Project 1) Analog Modular synth</h2>
<p1> 
	I wanted a modular synth, and I wanted an electronics project to keep my skills sharp.
 So I started looking into different schematics to build and found this wonderful youtube series by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MoritzKlein0?app=desktop">Moritz Klein</a>.
 I've taken his schematics and lightly adjusted them to add some extra goodies.

<h2>Project 2) Building an Electric Bass</h2>
<p1>	This project was mostly just to cut my teeth on making instruments, and I viewed it more as an art project an an engineering one.
 I'd already gotten comfortable with making things with sheet metal but hadn't done much with wood.
 I also wanted to learn how to play bass because at this point I'd been playing guitar for about 3 years; So I went ahead and bought a kit.
