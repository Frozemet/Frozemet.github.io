<h2>Project 1) Building an Electric Bass</h2>
<p1>	This project was mostly just to cut my teeth on making instruments, and I viewed it more as an art project an an engineering one.
 I'd already gotten comfortable with making things with sheet metal but hadn't done much with wood.
 I also wanted to learn how to play bass because at this point I'd been playing guitar for about 3 years; So I went ahead and bought a kit.
